> "Smart contracts are immutable. Frontends aren't. This is the biggest vulnerability in Web3 - and we're fixing it."

**Option 3** (Story):
> "When Nouns DAO's V1 frontend went offline, governance froze. Proposals couldn't be voted on. The treasury was inaccessible. Phoenix Forge brings it back - permanently."

## ✨ Closing Statements (Choose One)

**Option 1** (Call to Action):
> "Deploy once with PinMe. Live forever on IPFS and ENS. Phoenix Forge - because Web3 deserves Web3 infrastructure."

**Option 2** (Vision):
> "No more dead links. No more expired domains. No more centralized hosting. The resurrection protocol for truly decentralized frontends."

**Option 3** (Technical):
> "Content-addressed. Tamper-proof. Censorship-resistant. Permanently accessible. This is how Web3 frontends should work."
